# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning models. Customer churn, or customer attrition, is a critical concern for businesses across sectors. Understanding customer behaviors, identifying key factors contributing to churn, and predicting when customers are likely to churn are vital for reducing revenue loss and enhancing customer retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains 7043 records and 21 columns. Each record represents a telecom customer, and the columns include various features such as customer demographics, services subscribed, and usage patterns. The target variable is 'churn', indicating whether a customer has churned or not.

## Models Built
We built five machine learning models on the dataset:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes

## Results
After training and evaluating the models, we found that the logistic regression model achieved the highest accuracy and precision compared to the other models.
